How to use the major functions:

Detect the time with human input -
call detect_time(I) where I is an image, then click on two points to specify
1. the center of the clock
2. the edge of the clock

This returns the hour and the minute the clock is showing, and will pop up a window with the
bounding boxes for the hands outlined


Circle detection as an example of a very naive clock detector
call circle_bounding_box(I)
